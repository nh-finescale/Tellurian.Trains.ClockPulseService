# Clock Pulse Service

**This software calls the [*Fastclock API*](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModuleMeetingApp/wiki/API-Guidelines)
and creates logical pulses to drive analogue clocks.**

> If your clock is not a pulse-driven 12-hour clock, then my software is not the right solution. 
The alternative is to call the clock API and getting the time. 

## Motivation 
The whole point with the software is to eliminate the need for any other
logic translating time to pulses in other software. 
This software also automatically *fast-forward* the pulsing if the analogue time is not 
same or one minute after master clock time.

## Working Solution
During March 2022, I started to make [Clock Pulse Service](https://github.com/fjallemark/ClockPulseService) 
for polling the [clock API](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModuleMeetingApp/wiki/API-Guidelines) 
and generate data about pulses to send. 
I also bought a [RPi Relay Board](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RPi_Relay_Board) 
and mounted it om my old Raspberry Pi 2. 
Then I wrote an implementation of [IPulseSink](https://github.com/fjallemark/ClockPulseService/blob/master/Service/RpiRelayBoardPulseSink.cs) 
for that relay board, and had it to run on the Raspberry Pi to test it out, and after some adjustments, it seems to work as expected.

### Get the Software
To run the app locally, see [available deployments](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtjQMqeBcCjfkrkqVoRqBs5BIzpQiw?e=TvT6Bi). Select a folder and click download. 
It will be downloaded as a ZIP-file. Unzip and transfer to the computer you will run it on.

### Running the Software
This application must be run on a computer with an I/O device that can 
be connected to analouge clocks in the hall, for example a RUT-socket.

If the *fastclock server* is running in the cloud, you need an Internet connection,
but if you run the *fastclock server* locally, 
you can run both this application and the *fastclock server* on the same computer,
for example on a Raspberry Pi.


## From Clock API to Pulses 
The main logic of this application makes frequent calls to the *Fasclock API*
and determines when pulses to analogue clocks should be changed.
The logical pulses are:
- **Positive voltage**, sent when moving analouge clock to even minute.
- **Negative voltage**, sent when moving analouge clock to odd minute.
- **Zero voltage**, is sent after the configured pulse length duration.

### Fast Forwarding
When the time provided by calling the *fastclock* API differs more that one minute, 
the pulses are generated at a faster speed to make analouge clocks to sync faster.

When the *fastclock* is reset to a new session, it sets the time the session start time.
This often differs from what is presented on the analogue clocks,
so fast-forwarding starts automatically until the analogue clocks also is at
the session start time.
Fast-forwarding speed should be determined by the slowest fast-forwarding clock. 

### Start and Stop Indication
It is possible to indicate when the clock is stopped and started.

### Support of Hardware
This is a .NET application that can be compiled to run on most platforms.
The software is desiged to make it easy to support different ways to control an analogue clock.
You only need to implement a piece of software called a *sink* (see below).

### Flexible Configuration
Much of the behaviour is configurable. 
See this [example](https://github.com/fjallemark/ClockPulseService/blob/master/Service/appsettings.json). 

### Sinks
A *sink* is a component that translates logical clock signals to some form of I/O.
There are some ready-made *sinks*:
- **UdpBroadcastPulseSink** broadcasts ASCII bytes for pulses '+', '-' and '_', for start/stop '|' and '-' and session completed 'X'.
- **SerialPortPulseSink** sets DTR high for positive voltage, and RTS high for negative voltage. 
However, it can be configured to use DTR only for both positive and negative voltage.
- **RpiRelayBoardPulseSink** using three relays to control pulses and polarities.
The [Rpi Relay Board](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RPi_Relay_Board) is a relay hat for *Raspberry Pi*
that works with this software when running on Linux.
- **ZNServerSink** for providing time to the [*Zugnummern Meldeanlagen*](https://bmertins.de/FREMO/ZN/index.html). This sink is created by Dirkjan Kaper.
- There is also a **LoggingPulseSink** that logs to the console.
